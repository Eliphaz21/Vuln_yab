# Vuln_yab - Python-Based Vulnerability Scanner

Welcome to **Vulnyab** — a powerful and educational open-source vulnerability scanner built in Python.

This repository includes **two versions** of the scanner:

1. **Basic Scanner** – Great for learning port scanning fundamentals.
2. **Advanced Scanner** – A comprehensive vulnerability assessment tool that integrates Nmap, CVE lookups, PDF reporting, and risk scoring.

## Project Overview

**Vulnyab** is built for learners, ethical hackers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts. It starts with the fundamentals and scales to a semi-professional tool that demonstrates:

* Port scanning
* Service fingerprinting
* Vulnerability detection (CVE lookup)
* Report generation

---

## Basic Scanner

### Description

A simple port scanner using Python’s built-in `socket` module. It scans a given range of ports and prints all open ports on the target.

Ideal for beginners who want to:

* Understand TCP handshakes
* Learn how port scanners work from scratch

### Usage

```bash
cd basic/
python basic_scanner.py
```

* Enter the target IP/domain.
* Provide the port range (start & end).
* See the list of open ports.

### Requirements

* Python 3.x (tested with Python 3.6+)
* No external libraries needed

---

## Advanced Scanner

### Advanced Description

The advanced version elevates the scanner by using:

* `nmap` for detailed port & service scanning
* Public CVE databases for vulnerability detection
* `fpdf` for professional report generation

This tool suits intermediate to advanced users and demonstrates real-world vulnerability scanning practices.

### Features

* 🛠 Service & version detection via Nmap
*  Automatic CVE lookup (via Vulners API)
*  Generates PDF reports with:

  * Scan summary
  * Detected services & vulnerabilities
  * OS info, uptime, and traceroute
  * CVSS-based risk scoring with color-coded severity
*  Output in both terminal and PDF format

### Setup & Requirements

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install nmap requests fpdf
```

Install Nmap:

* **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install nmap
  ```
* **Windows:**
  Download from [https://nmap.org/download.html](https://nmap.org/download.html)

Ensure the `fonts/` folder exists in `advanced/` directory:

* Contains required fonts for PDF: `DejaVuSans.ttf`, `DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf`, `DejaVuSans-Oblique.ttf`

### Advanced Usage

```bash
cd advanced/
python scanner.py
```

* Enter target IP/domain
* Optional: Generate a PDF report

Scan results and CVEs are displayed in the terminal and saved to a PDF report.
